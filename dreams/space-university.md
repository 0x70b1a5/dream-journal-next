Space University. Many students heavily armed. Occasionally, invisible and very quiet amorphous slime aliens invade. They become visible only while lunging at prey. Their vision is weak and total stillness and silence renders them blind. Commonly, a student will be injured or killed in the middle of a passing period and all around will freeze, slowly draw weapons, etc, and await the next strike to detect and kill it. During a lecture an alien appears, I draw pistol and it lunges at me, however it is also armed and my 9mm pings off its gun in a slow motion sequence. I express my exasperation at this.

It seems the aliens can shapechange and wear clothes, carry weapons, etc as a camouflage strategy to alleviate their moments of vulnerability.
