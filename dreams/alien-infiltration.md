An alien infiltration had co-opted the world's governments. Two massive perpendicular highways, linking artificial archipelagos, had been constructed in the middle of the ocean, branching from a central megacity. Along the west->east road, vehicular traffic thundered over the raised bridgelanes, while masses of captured humans were force marched underneath. The endpoint was implicitly the deaths of those pedestrians, who force some reason were undesirable to the new regime. A resistance force had counter-infiltrated this procession, and at a point where the walking path rose and driving infrastructure lowered, and the two approached a conjunction, one operative took advantage of the noise to cover his escape from the foot column, behind a concrete wall/pillar. This was all done during beautiful tropical daylight, as was the entire dream. This operative also either had contacts among the (human) soldiers overseeing the maneuver, or the resistance movement had pre-cached weapons at his desertion location, because the last I saw of this scene he was carrying multiple directed energy rifles.

The dream then shifted, but kept both its tone and aesthetic, which was sunlit and bright and colorful, with pinks and greens and yellows and whites and blues all drawn from a tropical palette.

Now we were in an apartment in the megacity, specifically the two of yours apartment. At this stage the perspective was first person rather than third, and so the dream was clearly drawing from, but mixing, multiple memories. To wit, George was present, but Rosemary was not, although Julia was, shall we say, _latent_ with her, insofar as there was an overlay sensation of plurality when addressing dream!Julia.

The three of us were involved in preparing food while Tobias finished a task at his computer. This involved cooking dumpling sized portions of meat by submerging them in streams of high temperature, high pressure water (though the water did not splash even when it would normally have been deflected according to real physics).

There was a sort of preparatory tension, which foresaged the titanic conclusion of the dream story, but at the moment much more attention was spent on the sense data of cutlery and ceramics: much clinking, and light reflecting off water droplets, and steam, and heat conducted through cup handles, and the springy texture of beef cubes.

Also some amount of conversation, again with an undertone of hesitancy, of an imminently pendant future exertion, but I can recall few specifics except for being admonished/instructed in how to use the cooking water jet.

Roughly, like stew stock.

The four of us were then transported to a gigantic circular gate, shaped and operated like the iris diaphragm with covers a camera lens. This gate was far to the north of the megacity, along the south->north highway perpendicular to the west->east death march route. The road was deserted except for us, but to the south, in the city, a massive human-alien military operation was underway, its malice and intent directed towards us. Julia either was piloting from within or had been transformed into an inhuman humanoid, nearly as tall as the gate, slender, possessing robotic limbs with oversized claws and a metallic white shellskin. The head was sharp and angled, with no visible features aside from eyes and the suggestion of a tearing mouth/beak. This being/device could also shapeshift, and hovered under its own power in front of the gate.

Tobias was swooping about flying in some way, again blurred as to whether he had undergone a transformation, or was using a mecha/synthbio/energy being to do so.

George and I were distinctly still normal humans, but seated on a flying, winged saber toothed cat that George was steering.

None of the flying/hovering was physically accurate, but neither was there a sense of especial personal effort to accomplish it; it was like the "flying" of two action figures one causes to fight by holding them in midair.

At the enemy military installation, an enormous energy cannon had been erected, aimed at the gate. The populace of the Earth, previously kept oblivious to the dangers of the alien infiltrated new world order, was suddenly imposed upon by rolling global blackouts, as the energy cannon absorbed all productive capacity to charge its beam. There were flash cutscenes of people elsewhere suddenly being plunged into darkness midbite of their supper, and urban PA speakers urging calm.

The cannon fired, blazing along the whole length of the northern highway, and struck the gate, which glowed, and revealed the seams of its closure mechanism, but did not yield.

Then an enemy alien or alien controlled mecha, was deployed against our position, and it was vast and terrible, astride the highway, outsizing Julia's form, its details lost in its bulk and menace.

There was a very clear order of battle in which you, @⁨Julia De Benetti⁩, were both the most powerful and the most vulnerable. Your creature morphed into a rocky sphere with extensible arms, which shot out to grapple with the enemy alien. Tobias was attacking from above, and I was manning some sort of ranged weapon as George charioteered the wing'd cat.

The dream ended at this climax, and I do not know how the battle resolved.

I look forward to when it is possible to stream dreams directly from REM to a computer screen, because the color scheme and character design in this one was astounding.
